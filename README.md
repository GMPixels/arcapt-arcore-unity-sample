ARCapt sample - ARCore Unity
=====================
based on [Google ARCore SDK for Unity](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk)


This example extends the functionality of HelloAR scene from the official Google ARCore SDK for Unity samples. The demo loads the 3D collections of 3D models on start up. When user selects a 3D model, the model is downloaded on demand from ARCapt cloud and loads it in the user's phone. No prebuild 3D models! Everything is dynamically loaded.
